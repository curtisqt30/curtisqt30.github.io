### CPSC 120

* lab 10

    Lab 10, This lab was one of my favorites because it was the lab where both parts were primarily about reading files. I was curious about reading from files. I think it is a useful programming skill that I will be using a lot in my future classes.

* lab 12

    Lab 12, This lab was the most challenging, but I thought it was fun especially in part-1 where we were creating colored images and gifs. Part-1 also taught us how to utilize GraphicsMagick and it's built-in tools.

* Lab 1

    Lab1, This lab was the most straightforward, with it being just a simple hello world program, but it was very significant it was the first program I created, making it one of my favorite labs.
